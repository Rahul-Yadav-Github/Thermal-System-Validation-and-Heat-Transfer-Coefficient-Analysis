## üß† Overview

The project focuses on understanding and enhancing **condensation heat transfer** processes through surface engineering and setup development.

It comprises two major parts:

1. **Design and Fabrication of a Miniature Thermal Power Plant Setup**

   - Enables controlled **filmwise vs. dropwise condensation** experiments under low-pressure conditions.  
   - Includes complete chamber design, data acquisition setup, and thermal analysis components.

2. **Microscale Phase Change on Nano/Micro Textured Surfaces**  
   - Investigates **dropwise condensation** on superhydrophobic and biphilic surfaces.  
   - Employs **experimental and numerical simulations** to study droplet coalescence and jumping phenomena.  
   - Aims to enhance **heat transfer coefficients** for applications in **thermal power, desalination, and electronics cooling**.

## üß™ Experimental Procedure

1. **Vacuuming:**  
   Create a vacuum in the condensation chamber to remove non-condensable gases.

2. **Steam Generation:**  
   Supply saturated steam from the boiler to the chamber at ~1.5 bar.

3. **Condensation Experiment:**  
   Control subcooling using a chiller (water/ethylene glycol mixture).  
   Measure surface and vapor temperatures using RTDs and thermocouples.

4. **Data Processing:**  
   MATLAB scripts analyze steady-state temperature data to compute heat flux and heat transfer coefficients.  
   Results are compared with **Nusselt‚Äôs theoretical correlation** for validation.
